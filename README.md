Our solution to the project.

Everything related to the tool is in the 'src' folder.

Everything has been grouped into one file so just do 'python main.py' to run the tool.

Input files can be specified in the code, they are found in the folder 'csv-files'

Output can be found in the file 'evaluation_results.txt'.
